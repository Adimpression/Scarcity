# Scarcity
Be resourceful

Scarcity is an initiative by me, Ravindranath Akila to ***help*** save the planet. It took me quite a lot of beating from obstancles to understand that if we want to save the planet, we need to be smarter than our individual selves. While it is brave to set out on an endevour to do everything alone, one has to get used to the fact that there will always be smarter people, that a jack of all trades is a master of none and a collective effort is far more intelligent and efficient than an individual one when solving large problems. Here we start by solving a simple problem in a practical way. Any person set out to do something considers consciously or subconsciouly what resources she or he has. Human brain but is a suboptimal resource finder which relies on recency, safety and frequency of encounters to find out what resources are available (Read: Micheal Shermer, The Believing Brain. Daniel Kahneman,Thinking Fast and Slow). By keeping a log of resources one encounters during the course of the day and on a daily basis, one can quickly find the required resources for the task provided there's a tool to save and retrieve this information fast.

Remembere that time when you needed to do something important but you felt helpless? It is quite popular advice these days that when you're stuck with a problem, you need to consider what resources you have to be able to find a good solution.

Let's find one. Let's see what resources you've got!
